        If you are looking for reliable, fast, friendly, and proud service, you are looking at the right place, and if you do not want someone who will break the bank, you are coming to the right business. We make sure we have packages that will fit every budget and every bank account.  We strive always to make sure we not only achieve what our clients desire but exceed their expectations. 
        We guarantee that we will leave each house/office perfectly clean and promise you will get your money back if you are not impressed as we offer a money-back guarantee if you do not love our services, but we are so sure you will. We take great pride in a complete job well done and will never settle for dirt, grime, mold, or mildew getting past our three-team approach to cleaning. 
        We understand people are too busy to bother with the deep sanitization needed in a home, so we offer that in a package.

      <h3>Pros of professional cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        Relax and enjoy- You can spend many hours working on keeping your home clean, but is that truly the best use of your time? Call upon the professional team, and use the time you save for your creative endeavors, education, family time, or just relaxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right tools do better job- No matter how hard you scrub or mop, the tools and products you use do not work as well as the professional cleaning tools used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deeper clean- No matter how hard you scrub, or how often you pull out the spot cleaner to keep your carpets looking good, there is no substitute for deep, thorough cleaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        No need for supplies- If you plan on hiring a recurring cleaning service then you will not have to worry about always keeping your supplies fully stocked. The great part about it is whomever you hire will bring their own supplies
      </p>
      <p>
        A clean home/office- you will have the clean home you and your family deserve to have. We all live very hectic lives, trying to get from one place to another so when do you expect to clean? Being able to hire help for this will bring you peace of mind that this task does not need to be done by you and that is one less thing to worry about

      <h3>Cleaning tips</h3>
      <p>
        Commit yourself to tidying up-if you set aside the time, like you would for anything homework, piano practice, date night  it happens; if you don't, it doesn't
      </p>
      <p>
        Dust and vacuum- Concentrate your dusting on the tops of furniture and the undersides of shelves, on handrails, picture frames, knickknacks and TV screens
      </p>
      <p>
        Wipe mirrors and glasses- Use one damp microfiber cloth, followed by one dry cloth in wiping clean all the mirrors and glass surfaces
      </p>
      <p>
        Disinfect countertops and surfaces- Go through your house and wipe down the hard surfaces from countertops, appliances and cabinets to doorknobs, light switches, TV remotes and telephones
      </p>
      <p>
        Store items depending on the frequency of use-it's wise to have items that you use frequently within easy reach; anything you use infrequently can be stored in difficult-to-reach areas
