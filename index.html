    <h2>Coulston Mayett</h2>
    <h2>Big Boss</h2>
    <p>My name is Coulston. Many of my friends call me Big Boss, A nickname I selected for myself,and it stuck with me. I am from Kenya, a tiny country in Africa famous for its wild life, and safaris. I am not married yet, and definitely no childred. I have plans to be married someday.</p>
    <p>I love to learn new things and to challenge myself. I took this course because I felt it will give me a challenge to do things I did not do in my degree. My goal is to grow and embrace technology, and become good at it.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for eleven years now. I love the teachings of the church, and its organization. In my eleven years as a member, I have grown both spiritually and mentally. I even served a mission years back. I have a lot of favorite quotes, but one that stands out to me is from Elder Bedner on time management. He encouraged us to invest our time and not spend our time.</p>
    <p>I love reading, and my favorite sport is soccer. I am excited to be a part of this class and I am looking forward to know and learn from you.</p>
